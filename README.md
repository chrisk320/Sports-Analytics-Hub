# Sports Analytics Hub

This project is a full-stack application for analyzing NBA player performance and NFL betting opportunities, featuring a robust backend data pipeline, a RESTful API, and a modern React frontend. It supports both traditional and advanced NBA stats, personalized dashboards, NFL betting lines, and a conversational AI assistant.

## Project Architecture

This project is built with a professional, separated architecture to handle data collection and data serving as distinct processes.

### 1. Data Pipeline (Scraping & Seeding Scripts)

- **Data Scrapers:** Node.js scripts using **Puppeteer** to scrape `stats.nba.com` for traditional (season averages, game logs) and advanced stats (usage %, ratings, shooting percentages, etc). Scripts are resumable and handle dynamic web features.
- **Headshot Seeder:** Generates and saves official NBA headshot URLs for each player using a predictable pattern.

### 2. Database (PostgreSQL)

A PostgreSQL database serves as the single source of truth, with tables for:
- `players`: Player info and headshot URL.
- `player_season_stats`: Season averages for each player.
- `player_game_logs`: Detailed, game-by-game stats.
- `advanced_box_scores` & `advanced_scoring_logs`: Advanced metrics linked to specific games.
- `user_favorites`: Persistent, user-specific favorite player lists.
- `teams`: NBA team names and abbreviations.

### 3. External APIs

- **The Odds API**: Real-time NFL betting odds from multiple sportsbooks (DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM, BetUS, ESPN BET)
- **Google OAuth**: User authentication and profile management

### 4. Backend API (Express.js)

A RESTful API provides access to all data. Key endpoints:

- `GET /players/:playerId`: Get player info.
- `GET /players/:playerId/season-averages`: Latest season averages.
- `GET /players/:playerId/game-logs`: Last 10 game logs (traditional stats).
- `GET /players/:playerId/full-game-logs`: Last 10 game logs with advanced stats.
- `GET /players/:playerId/game-logs/:opponent`: Filter game logs by opponent.

#### Teams

#### User Favorites
- `GET /users/:userId/favorites`: Get userâ€™s favorite players.
- `POST /users/:userId/favorites`: Add a player to favorites.

#### NFL Betting
- `GET /nflbets/nflgames`: Get upcoming NFL games with team matchups and game times.
- `GET /nflbets/nflteamlines`: Get comprehensive betting lines (moneyline, spreads, totals) from multiple sportsbooks.
- `GET /nflbets/nflplayerprops`: Get NFL player prop bets (passing yards, rushing yards, receiving yards).

#### Chat (AI Assistant)
- `POST /chat`: Ask natural language NBA stats questions (e.g., "Show me LeBron's advanced stats last 5 games"). Returns answers and structured data.
