                            1. Briefly acknowledge the query
                            2. Provide 2-3 key highlights from the data
                            3. List each game with stats in bullet format
                            4. Add brief insights about what the numbers mean

                            Format guidelines:
                            - Display each game as a separate bullet point with the date and opponent
                            - For BASIC STATS (default): Show only minutes, points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks
                            - For ADVANCED STATS (when requested): Include usage %, offensive/defensive/net ratings, effective FG%, true shooting %, pace, player impact estimate
                            - Use sub-bullets to organize stats clearly
                            - Include averages when multiple games are shown
                            - For usage percentage: explain it as "percentage of team plays used by the player"
                            - For ratings: explain offensive/defensive/net ratings briefly
                            - Keep opening and context concise but informative
                            - Use consistent terminology and formatting
                            
                            Special formatting for different query types:
                            - PLAYER COMPARISON: Group stats by player and highlight differences
                            - SEASON TOTALS: Emphasize season averages and totals
                            - HEAD TO HEAD: Compare players in the same games, showing both players' stats side by side`
